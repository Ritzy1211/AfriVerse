## Impact Score™

### What is Impact Score?

The **Impact Score™** is AfriVerse's proprietary metric that measures the real-world influence of articles beyond traditional metrics like views and likes. It answers the question: *"Did this article actually change anything?"*

### How Impact Score is Calculated

The Impact Score combines multiple factors:

| Component | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Engagement Score** | 25% | Reader interactions (time spent, comments, saves) |
| **Share Score** | 25% | Social media shares and republications |
| **Citation Score** | 20% | References by other publications and researchers |
| **Community Score** | 30% | Verified real-world impacts reported by readers |

### Understanding the Score

| Score Range | Rating | Meaning |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| 90-100 | 🔥 Exceptional | Major real-world impact verified |
| 75-89 | ⭐ High Impact | Significant influence and engagement |
| 50-74 | 📈 Growing | Building momentum and influence |
| 25-49 | 🌱 Emerging | Early-stage impact |
| 0-24 | 📊 Baseline | Standard engagement levels |

### How to Report Impact

1. **Scroll to the bottom** of any article

4. **Describe the impact** — Be specific about what changed
5. **Provide evidence** (optional but helps verification) — Link to supporting documentation
6. **Submit** — Our team will review and verify
