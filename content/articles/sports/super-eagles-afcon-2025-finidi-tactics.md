As the **2025 Africa Cup of Nations** approaches, Super Eagles head coach **Finidi George** has unveiled his tactical blueprint, signaling a departure from the defensive setups of previous tournaments.

## The New Philosophy

In an exclusive interview with AfriVerse Sports, Finidi outlined his vision:

> "We have the talent to attack. Victor Osimhen, Ademola Lookman, Samuel Chukwueze—these players belong in an offensive system. I want us to dictate games, not react to them."

### Formation: 4-3-3

Finidi's preferred setup emphasizes:

- **High pressing** from the front three
- **Quick transitions** through midfield
- **Overlapping fullbacks** creating width
- **Goalkeeper involvement** in build-up play

## Confirmed Squad Preview

### Goalkeepers
| Player | Club | Age |
|--------|------|-----|
| Stanley Nwabali | Chippa United | 28 |
| Francis Uzoho | AC Ajaccio | 25 |
| Maduka Okoye | Udinese | 25 |

### Key Players to Watch

**Victor Osimhen** (Napoli)
- 2024 Stats: 28 goals, 8 assists
- Role: Central striker
- Finidi's take: "He's the best striker in the world right now"

**Ademola Lookman** (Atalanta)
- Europa League Final hero
- Expected role: Left wing or second striker
- Key attribute: Unpredictable dribbling

**Wilfred Ndidi** (Leicester City)
- Midfield anchor
- Defensive shield
- Experience: 65 caps

## Training Camp Plans

The team will gather in:

1. **Lagos** (December 28 - January 3): Initial camp
2. **Abu Dhabi** (January 5-12): International friendlies
3. **Morocco** (January 13): Final preparations

### Confirmed Friendlies

- **vs Saudi Arabia** - January 8, 2025
- **vs Tunisia** - January 11, 2025

## Historical Context

Nigeria's AFCON history:

| Year | Result | Host |
|------|--------|------|
| 2023 | Final (Lost) | Ivory Coast |
| 2021 | Round of 16 | Cameroon |
| 2019 | 3rd Place | Egypt |
| 2013 | **Champions** | South Africa |

## Fan Expectations

A recent AfriVerse poll showed:
